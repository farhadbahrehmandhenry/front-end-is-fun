# Front-end Engineer Tips

- Research application performance concepts and technology. i.e resource caching (images, fonts),content delivery,asynchronous programming, and real usermetrics.

# Software Development Topics

**Data Structures**

- _Knowlage storing and providing access to data in efficent ways._

- _Understanding the inner workings of common data structures and be able to compare and contrast their usage in various applications._

- _Knowing the runtimes for common operations as well as how they use memory_

**Algorithms**

- _Having a good understanding of the most common algorithms will likely make solving some of the questions a lot easier._
- _Review common algorithms such as traversals, divide and conquer, breadth-first search vs. depth-first search and understand the tradeoffs for each._
- _Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorizing the specific details of any given algorithm._

**Coding**

- _Make sure that you check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip through._

**Object-Oriented Design**

- _Good software needs to be extensible and maintainable._

**Internet Topics**

- _Fundamentals of how the internet works._
- _How browsers function at a high level, from DNS lookups and TCP/IP, to socket connections._
